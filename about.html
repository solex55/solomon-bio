									<h3 class="major">About Me</h3>
									<p>In my short time of working in the IT environment I have ventured into the software developing world, where I learnt how to implement software solutions by building web applications. 
										I wrote and test code, often using development tools. This role involved talking to clients and colleagues to assess and define what solution of system is needed, this helped me increase my verbal and communication skills as well as technical work. I have also served in the role of an IT support analysts who provides technical set-up, support and advice to IT users via email, phone, social media and in person. I either provided support within a particular organisation or to external businesses, customers of a particular product or on an ad hoc basis. While obeying the clarion call as a corper, 
										I served in the role of a network engineer, the role involves setting up, administering, maintaining and upgrading communication systems, local area networks and wide area networks for the organisation. 
										I was also responsible for security, data storage and disaster recovery strategies. As a fresh graduate with a strong academic background in IT combined with excellent internship experience as a help-desk analyst. I have consistently learnt and built-up technical troubleshooting skills used to rapidly and cost-effectively resolve challenging technical issues. I have equally used my time while serving as an intern to quickly learn and master new technologies, tools and testing methodologies. Having spent a short time in the information technology world, I have come to a realisation that there is more to it than just completing a course in my field of study. 
										I have taken out time to initiative and develop a deeper understanding of how I can use these skills in the tech work environments.
									</p>
									
									<h3 class="major">Future PLans</h3>
									<p>As I scale up the ranks in the IT job, I hope to become an IT technical consultant, who will provide technical expertise, develop and implement IT systems for external clients. 
										I hope to establish a firm in Nigeria where young and talented graduates would be given the opportunity to be involved at any or all stages of the project lifecycle, pitching for a contract; refining a specification with the client team; designing systems; managing part or all a project; after sales support and developing the code. I have always nursed the idea of been a project manager, after spending some time in the IT world and gaining good experience and required soft skills, I hope to fully venture into project managing. 
										I will use that role to organise people, time and resources to make sure information technology projects meet stated requirements and are completed on time and on budget either from start to finish or manage part of a larger programme. I hope to set up a hacking contest specifically for young cyber security graduate from all over Africa to contest in a series of challenges, where they would focus on system exploitation, reverse engineering and cryptography. 
										This would provide the continent in general with the opportunity to get the brightest mind and show off their computing skills.  As more devices are connected to the internet, they become vulnerable to hacking, due to the growing cyber threats in the world, this competition will offer apt solution because it will be crucial to find software security issues before cybercriminals.
